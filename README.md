# Extend Netflix UI

Built with Vite, React and Typescript

Originally conceived as a way of overriding Netflix's default UI (e.g. forcing the Continue Watching section to the top), this extension also displays review scores from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic when a user clicks the More Info icon (fully supported for movies, less so for TV shows)
